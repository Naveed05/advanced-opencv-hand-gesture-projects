⭐ Advanced OpenCV Hand Gesture Projects 
Top Level

A collection of real-time computer vision applications built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python.
This repository showcases advanced gesture-based interaction systems, including:

🕹 Hand-controlled games
🖱 Virtual hand cursor
✍ Air drawing + virtual painter
🎥 Video frame processing
🤝 Pinch-gesture math drawing
✊ Swipe gestures for keyboard control

These projects demonstrate strong skills in image processing, tracking, gesture recognition, and human-computer interaction (HCI).

🚀 Features
